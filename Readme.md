Nightmare
=========

Nightmare is a high level wrapper for [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) that lets you automate browser tasks.

The goal is to expose just a few simple methods, and have an API that feels synchronous for each block of scripting, rather than deeply nested callbacks. It's designed for automating tasks across sites that don't have APIs.

## Examples

Let's search on Yahoo:

```js
var Nightmare = require('nightmare');
new Nightmare()
  .goto('http://yahoo.com')
    .type('input[title="Search"]', 'github nightmare')
    .click('.searchsubmit')
    .run(function (err, nightmare) {
      if (err) return console.log(err);
      console.log('Done!');
    });
```

Or, let's extract the entirety of Kayak's home page after everything has rendered:

```js
var Nightmare = require('nightmare');
new Nightmare()
  .goto('http://kayak.com')
  .evaluate(function (page) {
    return document.documentElement.innerHTML;
  }, function (res) {
    console.log(res);
  })
  .run();
```

Or, here's how you might automate a nicely abstracted login + task on Swiftly:

```js
var Nightmare = require('nightmare');
var Swiftly = require('nightmare-swiftly');
new Nightmare()
  .use(Swiftly.login(email, password))
  .use(Swiftly.task(instructions, uploads, path))
  .run(function(err, nightmare){
    if (err) return fn(err);
    fn();
  });
```

And [here's the `nightmare-swiftly` plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare-swiftly).

## API

#### new Nightmare(options)
Create a new instance that can navigate around the web.

The available options are:
* `timeout`: how long to wait for page loads, default `5000ms`
* `interval`: how frequently to poll for page load state, default `50ms`
* `port`: port to mount the phantomjs instance to, default `12301`

#### .goto(url)
Load the page at `url`.

#### .back()
Go back to the previous page.

#### .refresh()
Refresh the current page.

#### .url(cb)
Get the url of the current page, the signature of the callback is `cb(url)`.

#### .click(selector)
Clicks the `selector` element once.

#### .type(selector, text)
Enters the `text` provided into the `selector` element.

#### .upload(selector, path)
Specify the `path` to upload into a file input `selector` element.

#### .evaluate(fn, cb, [arg1, arg2,...])
Invokes `fn` on the page with `args`. On completion it passes the return value of `fn` as to `cb(res)`. Useful for extracting information from the page.

#### .wait()
Wait until a page finishes loading, typically after a `.click()`.

#### .wait(ms)
Wait for `ms` milliseconds e.g. `.wait(5000)`

#### .wait(selector)
Wait until the element `selector` is present e.g. `.wait('#pay-button')`

#### .wait(fn, value, [delay])
Wait until the `fn` evaluated on the page returns `value`. Optionally, refresh the page every `delay` milliseconds, and only check after each refresh.

#### .screenshot(path)
Saves a screenshot of the current page to the specified `path`. Useful for debugging.

#### .useragent(useragent)
Set the `useragent` used by PhantomJS.

#### .authentication(userName, password)
Set the `userName` and `password` for accessing a web page using basic authentication.

#### .viewport(width, height)
Set the `width` and `height` of the viewport, useful for screenshotting. Weirdly, you have to set the viewport before calling `.goto()`.

#### .use(plugin)
Useful for using repeated code blocks, see the example with Swiftly login and task creation in the docs above.

#### .run(cb)
Executes the queue of functions, and calls your `cb` when the script hits an error or completes the queue. The callback signature is `cb(err, nightmare)`.

## Plugins

Here's a list of plugins, pull request to add your own to the list :)

* [nightmare-swiftly](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare-swiftly)

## Usage

You'll need to include the nightmare module, and already have phantomjs itself installed:

```bash
$ sudo brew update && brew install phantomjs
$ npm install --save nightmare
```
